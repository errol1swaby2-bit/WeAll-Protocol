# This config is used ONLY when CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN is NOT set.

# For token-based tunnels, you can ignore this file entirely and just set:
#   CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=...

tunnel: YOUR_TUNNEL_NAME_OR_UUID

# Option B credentials:
#  - If you use a named tunnel (not token), place the tunnel credentials JSON here:
#      cloudflared/<tunnel-uuid>.json
#  - Then set credentials-file to match.
